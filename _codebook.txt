%% Technical Information about the Files
%
% For more details, see sections "Details about the Data" below
%
% We acquired data from 20 subjects, we provide data data from 19 subjects. 
% One subject was excluded due to falling asleep, the data from this 
% subject are not provided. Another subject (subject 5) was excluded upon 
% data inspection because the participant  obviously misunderstood the 
% experiment, choosing the disadvantegous gamble with a higher probability 
% and choosing incorrectly in non-brainer trials (see manuscript) more than
% 50% of trials. This subject's data are provided, take care to exclude 
% this subject from analysis as is done in the analysis scripts.
%
% .txt files:
% The original data files are four .txt files per subject, for the passive
% learning session and the active session from the additive and
% multiplicative day. 
% The filenames contain a subject ID (1-19) and a suffix denoting the
% session (1 = passive, 2 = active). Since the passive session is only 
% relevant for the neuroimaging data analysis (no choice data) and not part
% of the results in the manuscript, we only provide data from the active 
% sessions. These are placed in the folders "TxtFiles_additive" for the 
% additive day and "TxtFiles_multiplicative" for the multiplicative day. 
%

%% Structure of the Data within the File
% The .txt files contain trial-wise (rows) information about different
% variables (columns), information is tab-separated.
%
% The "allData.mat" file contains all relevant variables, with 19 entries
% per variable (most variables are cells, such that the 19 entries each
% contain multiple data entries, e.g. as many as there were trials for that
% subject). It is this data file that all analyses are based upon.


%% Details about the Data - .txt files
% Data from subject 5 should not be analysed (see section "Technical 
% Information about the Files" above)
% 
% The .txt files contain the following variables (columns):
%
% subjID: Subject ID (same value in all rows)
%
% session: Number of session (passive learning = 1, active decision = 2) 
% (same value in all rows)
%
% Block: Number of block (updates after the break (see description of 
% experiment in manuscript))
%
% trialCount: Counter of each event/trial
%
% earnings: Monetary endowment at the beginning of trial. In the active
% session, this value is the same for all rows as the outcome of the
% gambles was not realised.
%
% Gam1Onset: Time point when first gamble is presented (in seconds)
%
% Gam2Onset: Time point when second gamble is presented (in seconds)
%
% FBOnset: Time point when subject can choose between gambles (in seconds)
%
% KPs: Key-press while subject can choose. 9 = left button press. 8 = right
% button press. If the subject pressed multiple times, these multiple 
% button presses are listed, separated by comma
%
% RT: Time points (in seconds) of key-press responses while subject can 
% choose (FBOnset needs to be subtracted in order to obtain RT)
%
% KPlate: Key-press after decision period per trial is over
% 
% RTlate: Time point of late key-press – NOT CORRECTLY RECORDED – it is 
% always 1s after decision period per trial is over, thus not the true RT
%
% KP_Final: Final key-press amongst the key presse made during the response
% period (i.e. this is the final entry from variable "KPs)
%
% SLOnset: Time point when selection is highlighted
%
% Gam1_1: Change in wealth associated with reward-cue 1 of gamble 1. On the
% additive day, the value of this variable describes the additive change in
% wealth DKK. On the multiplicative day, the value of this variable
% describes the multiplicative change in wealth in DKK*100. For example, a 
% value of 183.02 describes a multiplication of current wealth with 1.8302
%
% Gam1_2: Same as above for reward-cue 2 of gamble 1
%
% Gam2_1: Same as above for reward-cue 1 of gamble 2
%
% Gam2_2: Same as above for reward-cue 2 of gamble 2
%
% Jit1: There is a 1.5-3 s random (uniform) delay between the onset of the 
% first gamble and the onset of the second gamble. For a given trial, this
% delay is 1 + this variable value
%
% Jit2: Same as for Jit1, but for delay between second gamble and response 
% period
%
% Jit3: 2-4 s random (uniform) inter-trial-interval between trials,
% corresponding to the value of this variable

%% Details about the Data - allData.mat file
% For details about how these variables were computed, see "readingData.py"
% Most variables are 1 x 19 cell arrays, each cell containing the data for 
% one of the 19 subjects. 
% Data from subject 5 should not be analysed (see section "Technical 
% Information about the Files" above)
%
% A number of variables relate to linear and logarithmic utility. For all
% of them, the following applies:
%
% Linear utility means the additive change in wealth. In the additive
% session, this is equal to the change in wealth that a given fractal will
% always induce, e.g. +428 DKK. In the multiplicative session, this is
% change will vary depending on the initial wealth. For example, for a
% fractal inducing a multiplication of the current wealth with 1.4962, the
% absolute change in wealth with an initial wealth of 1000 DKK would be
% (1000*1.4962)-1000.
% 
% Logarithmic utility is the logarithm of the multiplicative change in
% wealth. For the multiplicative session, this is equal to the log of the
% multiplicative change in wealth that fractal always induces, e.g. a
% multiplication of the initial wealth with 1.4962. For the additive
% session, this change will vary depending on the initial wealth. For
% example, for a fractal inducing an additive change of +428, the
% multiplicative change in wealth with an initial wealth of 1000 DKK would
% be log((1000+428)/1000).
%
