This folder is too big for Github. You need to download the following folder on the OSF.
https://mfr.osf.io/render?url=https://osf.io/ksm3z/?action=download%26mode=render
This will unzip to two folders
Put the contents of matjags into the matjags folder on this repo.
And put the contents of the samples&stats folder into, you guessed it, the samples&stats folder on this repo.
